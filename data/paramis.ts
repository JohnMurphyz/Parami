    "shortDescription": "The practice of giving and opening without expectation of return.",
    "fullDescription": "Dāna is the willingness to give and open without religious or pious motives, simply doing what is required in any moment. It is learning to trust in your fundamental richness, realizing you do not need to constantly secure your ground. This perfection involves a surrendering process where you give up your psychological 'demand' and the basic criteria of that demand. Generosity is also a form of communication that must transcend irritation and self-defensiveness to be truly open and naked.",
    "story": "The Buddha once taught his followers to release their 'cows'—the things we think are essential for our existence but are actually obstacles to our happiness. He told a story of a farmer who was distraught because his twelve cows ran away and his crops were eaten by insects. The Buddha noted that he and his monks were happy people because they had no cows to lose, illustrating that true generosity and non-attachment lead to immense freedom.",

It involves seeing that worldly pleasures are like a 'borrowed fancy carriage'—eventually, the owners (time and change) will take them back, leaving the un-renounced person dejected. True renunciation is 'swimming against the current' of race-old urges and self-centered conditioning to find an island where there is no clinging. It is the practice of emptying your boat so that it can travel faster toward liberation.",
    "story": "At age 29, Prince Siddhartha looked upon his sleeping wife and son one last time and slipped away in the dark hours before dawn.

It is the ability to see situations as they are, without the interference of the ego's 'watcher'. It transforms primitive preconceptions and allows one to see the interdependent and impermanent nature of all phenomena. True wisdom means being 'suspended nowhere,' not distinguishing between 'this' and 'that'.",

It is not the kind of energy used to work hard because one feels they 'must,' but rather a quality of delight in involvement. It involves the 'Fourfold Right Diligence': preventing unwholesome seeds from arising, helping those that have arisen to subside, and helping wholesome seeds to arise and grow. It is the energy that makes one truly alive, with shining eyes and solid steps.",

It is not merely about trying to be a hard worker or a forebearing person, but about having no expectation or impatience. It requires an awareness of the 'space' between oneself and a situation, ensuring one is never shocked or disturbed by destructive or chaotic events. True inclusiveness means your heart is as large as a river, capable of receiving a handful of salt without becoming undrinkable.",
